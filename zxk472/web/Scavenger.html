      <td colspan="3">Scavengers are humanoid quadrupeds, possessing long, lanky forearms and short legs. They have mask-like faces from which a variety of antlers, horns, or beards protrude, and may have tails, spines, or frills of varying lengths. They come in a wide range of colors, but most commonly in browns, blacks, and whites of varying tones. Their eyes (which may or may not possess visible pupils) can also be a wide range of colors, angles, and sizes. They are very expressive, and can exhibit many emotions.</td>

      <td colspan="3"><p>Scavengers display the most color variation of any creature in the game, being capable of exhibiting every color. Whilst they are predominantly neutral, earthy tones, they can also display a wide range of vivid colors. They usually have 3-6 colors depending on their physical traits; body color, stomach color, head/gradient color, antler/horn accent, eye color and pupil color. These may sometimes overlap (e.g. Scavengers with the same antler/horn accent and stomach color are common).</p>
        <p>Their main features can be broken down into a few categories - head decoration, stomach patch, gradients and back decoration. Scavengers can have a few variations of antlers on different positions on their head, as well as 'beards', and back frills of various shapes and sizes.</p>
      <p>The size of each body part can vary as well. This is most noticeable in their tails, and Scavengers may showcase a range of tail lengths within each group, but otherwise it typically remains close to average for other body parts. However, the odd Scavenger who has body parts skewed to the extremes may be observed every once in a while.</p></td>
